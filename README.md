# Cookie-Orders-Validation

This project creates a platform for users to log cookie orders with the ability to validate the user's input. 

Tasks:
1. Create a new schema and table for cookie orders and forward engineer.
2. Set up a new modularized project, with crud functionality as shown above.
3. Add validation to the create method: All fields are required, name and cookie_type must be at least 2 characters, number must be a positive number.
4. Redirect and display any validation errors on the create page.
5. Add validation to the edit page, same validations as for create.
6. Redirect back to the edit page for that same order to show any errors.
7. Pre-populate the edit fields with the existing record's values.
